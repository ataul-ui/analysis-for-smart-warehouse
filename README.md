ooooooh I can use nvidia omniverse for synthetic data generation for this project, and then all the ml stuff I learned will be used without changing any of the ml parts. No need for dataops and scripts then. https://medium.com/@nvidiaomniverse/from-virtual-to-reality-how-synthetic-data-will-train-smarter-robots-for-industrial-applications-0c4b744d4ae0 



I can do something with prometheus using the time series knowledge I learned here, and use grafana instead of manually writing promql queries

And see what you can do with sentry.io for monitoring: https://sentry.io/welcome/ 

also do load tests on prometheus on aks project, read through this: https://medium.com/swlh/feed-prometheus-with-locust-performance-tests-as-a-metrics-source-d8d2bfec918c

This project has been suspended for the time being. I might work on it on another time

My plan in this project is to use github actions and terraform together

In other word this will be a DataOps/GitOps project

Readme will be writen when the project is finished, if you have any thoughts/suggestions on the current code in this repository please contact me at ataul.akbar@gmail.com
