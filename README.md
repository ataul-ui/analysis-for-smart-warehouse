ooooooh I can use nvidia omniverse for synthetic data generation for this project, and then all the ml stuff I learned will be used without changing any of the ml parts. No need for dataops and scripts then. https://medium.com/@nvidiaomniverse/from-virtual-to-reality-how-synthetic-data-will-train-smarter-robots-for-industrial-applications-0c4b744d4ae0 

Use mostly.ai connectors as data destination upload and use dvc to log into it and use it on the jupyter notebook file

Readme will be writen when the project is finished, if you have any thoughts/suggestions on the current code in this repository please contact me at ataul.akbar@gmail.com
