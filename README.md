I can use facebook prophet for the time-series part. And if possible I can include spark. We'll see. I might do the certification sometime else.

Hmmm I think I can use this repo for my next project on ml stuff


Do drop using kalman filters, don't use facebook prophet, use spark to count which sensors can be dropped.

# ML-for-IoT-final

This is the first repository in the "Building a Smart Factory" series.
To see the second project please go to this repository.

## Description

The "ML-for-IoT-final" project focuses on implementing machine learning techniques for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The code provided in this repository aims to address specific challenges and demonstrate the usage of ML algorithms in IoT contexts.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ataul-ui/ML-for-IoT-final.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ML-for-IoT-final
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Please note that Python 3 and pip need to be installed on your system.


## Features

This notebook reads in the MERLsense data, and attempts to discover which sensors can be removed to reduce cost for the factory. 
The algorithms used are pca analysis, k-means clustering, and time-series analysis.
