Use selenium to download the dataset instead of just doing pd_read()

My plan in this project is to use github actions and terraform together

In other word this will be a DataOps/GitOps project

Readme will be writen when the project is finished, if you have any thoughts/suggestions on the current code in this repository please contact me at ataul.akbar@gmail.com
