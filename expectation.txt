I'll use terraform to provition azure blob storage, dvc to create remote storage (aka send the data, which is generated by the code, to azure cloud), and github actions to execute it using cron jobs. Like github actions will execute the everything including the ml code, I think. I think for ML code I'll use spark SQL, this way I'll get practice using sparkSQL as well.
















Use sparkml to train the model, then use spark streaming to detect model drift. I'll look into this more soon.

I can use github actions to deploy some of the code to azure cloud, I don't
need to create a python script for it.

Use this video as reference, don't create a production repo, use cronjob for github actions and manually upload the data/model to a folder (or azure blob storage):

Don't use dvc for this project, but reference in the blog that you used dvc in the alzhiemer's project.

# ML-for-IoT-final

This is the first repository in the "Building a Smart Factory" series.
To see the second project please go to this repository.

## Description

The "ML-for-IoT-final" project focuses on implementing machine learning techniques for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The code provided in this repository aims to address specific challenges and demonstrate the usage of ML algorithms in IoT contexts.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ataul-ui/ML-for-IoT-final.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ML-for-IoT-final
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Please note that Python 3 and pip need to be installed on your system.


## Features

This notebook reads in the MERLsense data, and attempts to discover which sensors can be removed to reduce cost for the factory. 
The algorithms used are pca analysis, k-means clustering, and time-series analysis.
